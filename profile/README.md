## 🚀 About Us

The **Cooperative Automated Mobility Innovations (CAMIs) Lab** at the [University of Georgia](https://engineering.uga.edu/) is dedicated to building a safer, more sustainable, and efficient transportation system. 

We leverage emerging technologies—such as communication, automation, electrification, shared mobility, and smart infrastructure—to solve real-world transportation challenges.

### 🔬 Research Focus

Our work primarily focuses on three key pillars:

| 📊 Data Collection & Analytics | 🚦 Traffic Management & Control | 🚗 Real-world Experiments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Employing AI techniques and statistical models to extract insights and pinpoint challenges within existing transportation systems. | Developing strategies and vehicle control models (CAVs) to improve safety and efficiency using smart infrastructure. | Creating full-scale and reduced-scale testbeds for validating theoretical models and refining strategies with field data. |
